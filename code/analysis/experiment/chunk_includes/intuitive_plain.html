<p>Each page of this survey will present you with two sentences. Please read each of the sentences carefully.</p>
<p>For each sentence, you will indicate your gut reaction. If you think a sentence seems fully normal and understandable to you, select that sentence by clicking on it. In other words, if you think it is very odd, awkward, or difficult for you to understand, select the other sentence. When you are satisfied with your selection, click &ldquo;Validate&rdquo; to move on to the next page.</p>
