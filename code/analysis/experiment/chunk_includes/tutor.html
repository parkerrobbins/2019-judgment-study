<div style="width: 40em;">
<p>Each page of this survey will present you with two sentences. Please read each of the sentences carefully.</p>
<p>For each sentence listed, you will indicate whether or not you think the sentence seems English-sounding. Suppose that you are tutoring a friend who speaks English as a second language: would you tell them that this sentence makes them sound like a native speaker?</p>
<p>If you think that a sentence sounds native-like, select that sentence by clicking on it. In other words, if you think that a sentence sounds strange or unnatural, select the other sentence. When you are satisfied with your selection, click &ldquo;Validate&rdquo; to move on to the next page.</p>
<p>Note that you will only be able to select one of the two sentences.</p>
