<p>Here is more information about the purpose of this study and expected results.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose of the Study</strong>: </p>
<p>To understand language, linguists must collect and analyze data from speakers. In order to build a complete picture, however, linguists must not only rely on what speakers say, but also understand what types of sentences are <em>not</em> considered acceptable by speakers of a language. For example, if a linguist studying English only ever heard sentences like <em>The cat chased the dog</em>, s/he could not be sure that <em>The cat the dog chased </em>is not also a valid sentence in English. Grammaticality judgment tasks are designed to allow linguists to fully understand the rules of a language by explicitly testing predictions about its rules. This is a very powerful method, but it is not always conducted in a consistent manner. Task instructions, for example, can vary widely from researcher to researcher, so the purpose of this study is to find out if how the task is framed affects speakers&rsquo; judgments. In order to do this, participants were randomly assigned to one of four instruction conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Hypotheses</strong>: </p>
<p>The study&rsquo;s research question is whether or not specific types of instructions will prime participants to give judgments based on prescriptive grammar rules. Prescriptive grammar rules are guidelines taught in school about how language &ldquo;should&rdquo; be spoken, such as <em>Never end a sentence with a preposition</em>, even though sentences that end in prepositions sound very natural. Two of the instruction conditions ask participants to assume a role, either as an English professor or an ESL tutor. The other two simply ask for &ldquo;a gut reaction,&rdquo; but one gives a specific reminder to base answers only on intuition and not on what one might have learned about what is &ldquo;proper&rdquo; or &ldquo;correct&rdquo; English.</p>
<p>The hypothesis is that in three of the four instruction conditions&mdash;the ESL peer tutor condition, the plain intuitive condition, and the intuitive condition with the extra reminder&mdash;participants may choose the more natural-sounding sentences, i.e. the sentences that end in prepositions, contrary to the prescriptive rule. In the professor instruction condition, however, the hypothesis is that participants may prefer sentences that align with this prescriptive rule.</p>
<p>Further, the prediction is that this condition may cause participants to over-apply this rule, preferring an unnatural construction over one that seems to contradict the prescriptive rule. If true, this would suggest not only that instructions affect how participants judge sentences, but would also point to a discrepancy between the type of judgment linguists would like to elicit&mdash;gut feelings about language&mdash;and the type of judgment participants are providing&mdash;intuitions based on what participants were explicitly taught.</p>
