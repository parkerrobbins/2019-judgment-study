<div style="width: 40em;">
<p>Each page of this survey will present you with two sentences. Please read each of the sentences carefully.</p>
<p>For each sentence, you will indicate whether or not you think the sentence is a well-formed, grammatical sentence of English. Suppose one of these sentences were included in a term paper submitted for a senior-level college English course that is taken only by English majors: would you expect the professor to accept this sentence?</p>
<p>If you think a sentence would be accepted, select that sentence by clicking on it. In other words, if you think a sentence would not be regarded as grammatical English by an appropriately trained person, select the other sentence. When you are satisfied with your selection, click &ldquo;Validate&rdquo; to move on to the next page.</p>
<p>Note that you will only be able to select one of the two sentences.</p>
